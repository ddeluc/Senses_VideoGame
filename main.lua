	GD50 Final Assignment
	Senses

	Author: Dante Deluca

	Senses is a 2D platformer made in Love2D. In this game, the player
	must navigate through a dark map with only a radius of visibility
	(vision) that surrounds the player and a radar-like mechanic that
	indicates where there may be potential enemies (hearing). The playerâ€™s
	objective is to collect three special coins that will allow the player
	to completely restore their senses and escape the darkness. Throughout
	the game, there are floating ghosts that will follow the player. The
	player can attack the ghosts and destroy them, but if they get caught,
	it is game over. The level and the enemies are not randomly generated.

	*** CITATIONS (IF ANY) ***

	Most of the formating for the common lua scripts are
	modeled after the scripts used the "GD50 Introduction
	to Game Development" Course by Colton Ogden.
